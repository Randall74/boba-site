    <h1>Join me on my journey to becoming a full-stack developer</h1>
    <p>My plan is to learn as many aspects of the full-stack environment, in addition to the knowledge I have gained over the past 20 years in the IT field.</p>
    <p>This page will change as I progress through the different phases of my learning cycle. I plan to keep either a blog or a to-do list that I will check off as I move along.</p>
    <h2>More to come...</h2>
