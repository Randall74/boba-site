                </div>
                <p>My plan is to learn as many aspects of the full-stack environment, in addition to the knowledge I have gained over the past 20 years in the IT field.</p>
                
                <p>The plan is to <em>literally</em> make changes and additions to this page as I progress through the different phases of my learning cycle. I plan to keep either a blog or a to-do list that I will check off as I move along.</p>
                
                <p>The ultimate goal is to create a kind of learning roadmap and pass along the information and steps I have taken, in order to make it easier for a new student - or anyone that is considering becoming a software/Web developer - to progress in their studies.</p>
